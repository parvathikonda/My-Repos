In this directory you can put your own custom scripts which extend the startstop-scripts in etc/init.d

The init-hook-scripts are executed by the init-scripts before or after a certain operation. This is defined by following a naming scheme.

<name of the init-script>-<name of the operation>-<pre or post>

Post scripts will be run with the exit code of the actual script as
parameter.

Example:
nagios-reload-pre will be executed when you run "etc/init.d/nagios reload" or "omd reload nagios" just before the actual reload.


Real-live use case:
 - Imagine your etc/nagios/conf.d/myconfig is the clone of a git repository. Whenever you reload Nagios, the init-hook-script will do a
   cd etc/nagios/conf.d/myconfig
   git pull
   and update the config files from the central repository. Then the actual reload follows.

 - Apache stops all fcgi servers on stop ( and therefor on logfile
   rotation ). There is a sample script which start Thruks fcgi daemon
   after the apache reload.

Currently only the following scripts can be used, all others are ignored:
nagios-*-pre
nagios-start-post
nagios-stop-post
nagios-reload-post

shinken-*-pre

icinga-*-pre
icinga-start-post
icinga-stop-post
icinga-reload-post

apache-*-pre
apache-start-post
apache-stop-post
apache-reload-post

mysql-*-pre
mysql-start-post
mysql-stop-post

npcd-*-pre
npcd-start-post
npcd-stop-post
