# Custom environment variables
#
# Here you can set environment variables. These will
# be set in interactive mode when logging in as site
# user and also when starting the OMD processes with
# omd start.
#
# This file has shell syntax, but without 'export'.
# Better use quotes if your values contain spaces.
#
# Example:
#
# FOO="bar"
# FOO2="With some spaces"
