title: Temperature sensors (by CISCO-ENVMON-MIB or CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB)
agents: snmp

description:
 This check monitors the state of temperature sensors
 on older Cisco devices using data from the
 {CISCO-ENVMON-MIB} or the {CISCO-ENTITY-SENSOR-MIB}.

 The check supports both sensor status and device levels provided, if
 existent.

perfdata:
 The current temperature in degrees celsius

item:
 The description of the sensor as provided by the device.

inventory:
 One check for each available sensor is created.

[parameters]
parameters(dict): This checks parameters are a dictionary with the
 following (optional) keys:

  {"levels"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the upper levels. No defaults.

  {"levels_lower"}: A tuple (warn, crit) containing the lower levels. No defaults.

  {"output_unit"}: "c", "f" or "k", the check will output the temperature in the
 specified unit. If this is not set, output is in degrees Celsius.

  {"input_unit"}: "c, "f" or "k". By default, the check interprets the sensor value
 according to the unit sent by the device. This key allows to override that. Tread
 lightly, as this may lead to a misinterpreted temperature. Should only be used if
 the device reports its unit incorrectly.

  {"device_levels_handling"}: Specifies how the temperature status
  (too hot/too cold) provided by the device, respectively the device's levels are
  handled compared to levels set by the user. Options are "usr", "dev",
  "best", "worst", "devdefault", "usrdefault". "usr" and "dev" means respecting
  only the user's resp. the device's levels, wheras "usrdefault" and "devdefault"
  take the user's resp. the device's levels if present, otherwise try to use the
  device's resp. the user's levels.
