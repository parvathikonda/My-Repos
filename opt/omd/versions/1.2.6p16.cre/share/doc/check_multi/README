What is check_multi?
--------------------
check_multi is kind of a wrapper plugin which takes benefit of the 
Nagios 3.x capability to display multiple lines of plugin output. 
It calls multiple child plugins and displays their output in the 
long_plugin_output. A summary is given in the standard plugin output.

Normally the child return code with the highest severity becomes the 
parent (check_multi) plugin return code. But you can influence this 
by specifying flexible state evaluation rules.

The configuration is very simple: a NRPE-stylish config file contains 
a tag for each child plugin and then the check command line.
