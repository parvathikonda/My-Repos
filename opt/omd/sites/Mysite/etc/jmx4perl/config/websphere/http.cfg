# HTTP Checks

include threads.cfg

# HTTP Thread Pool Utilization
# Check of relative pool size, i.e. the ratio between actual created threads 
# to the number of maximal available threads.

# Web-Sessions

# Check for the number of session uses. The maximal number of sessions is not available 
# and should be provided as argument to this check (default is 200).

# A unique part of the name contained in the 'mbeanIdentifier' key of the MBean 
# must be used for the name (e.g. 'jolokia' for the Jolokia agent).
